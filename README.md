# Turing Salaries

This app will allow students to enter salary data from job offers they have received and accepted. We also want a means for students to be able to search for data within the app to find cities and companies where they might have interest applying for work.

It would also be nice to allow public access to view this data so employers can see what other companies/cities are offering for particular roles.

Once a student enters some new salary data, we'd like the app to post the data in our salaries channel in Slack at Turing to have discussion over the job post, etc..
